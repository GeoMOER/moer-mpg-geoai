Please do the the warm up R-spatial exercise using the data provided from the course server. You can either work with the large image (1.1 GB) or use the small excerpt. Alternatively, you can cut out a small part of the large aerial image on your own and do the exercise on this part.

Put your code and results including the figures of your data into a PDF file and upload it to ILIAS. 


If you experienced any problems or there were ambiguities in the implementation, please document them in a comprehensible way.

Please upload this PDF file to ILIAS before the start of the next session.

**Optional:**
If you are already experienced in `Rmarkdown` you can put your results -- both the classified images and your code -- in a `Rmarkdown` file and convert it to a PDF document.
Hint: If you need help with `Rmarkdown`, have a look at [R Markdown Quick Tour
](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_quick_tour.html)
