## Physical fundamentals

### Laws

#### Planck's law (Plancksches Strahlungsgesetz)
Every physical body spontaneously and continuously emits electromagnetic radiation. The spectral radiance of a given body describes the spectral emissive power for particular radiation frequencies, based on area and angle. The formula for [Planck's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law) is given as:
<p align="center">
  <img src="../assets/images/unit02/Planck_formula_wavelength.png">
</p>

This shows how radiated energy emitted at shorter wavelengths (&lambda;) increases more rapidly with temperature (&Tau;) than energy emitted at longer wavelengths (&lambda;). This formula can also be rewritten in terms of frequency (&upsilon;) and other variables. Planck's radiation law shows how the radiation intensity is distributed across a single wavelength. It reveals that as temperature increases, so too does the total radiated energy of a body.

#### Wien's displacement law (Wiensche Verschiebungsgesetz)
Another fundamental law of black-body radiation, [Wien's displacement law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law) describes where the maximum intensity of a wavelength lies. This maximum intensity is inversely proportional to the temperature of the emitting body. This inverse relationship between wavelength and temperature means that as temperature increase, the wavelength of the thermal radiation becomes smaller.

where (&lambda;) is the wavelength of the maximum intensity and (&Tau;) is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin) of the emitting body. This law describes why the temperature (&Tau;) is responsible for the shifted peaks in the above graphic.

### Sensor types

### Passive sensors
The most common remote sensing imagery comes from passive multispectral sensors. These sensors pick up the natural light from the sun and its reflectance from the Earth's surface. The images are similar to an ordinary photograph with a digital camera and consist of different channels for particular wavelengths. Most multispectral platforms have at least three spectral channels (red, green, blue aka RGB) and a maximum of twelve spectral channels. Hyperspectral sensors take this to the next level and consist of over 100 channels for different wavelengths.

### Active sensors
Active sensors emit their radiation by themselves. This makes them less dependent on environmental conditions, such as the angle of the sun. Some sensors, such as radar, have long wavelengths that can penetrate through clouds, which means no interruptions in the data collection and makes the imagery more consistent. LiDAR is another such type of sensor that emits and measures light (just like radar uses radio waves) to collect measurements. As light has a much shorter wavelength than radio, LiDAR is adept at detecting small objects and is growing in popularity among the remote sensing community.

### Reflective properties

Remote sensing is based on measuring the radiation that is reflected or emitted from bodies on Earth's surface. See [Introduction to Remote Sensing](https://seos-project.eu/remotesensing/remotesensing-c01-p06.html) from the SEOS Project for more details.

### Spatial resolution
Spatial resolution is familiar to us all. This is the resolution or how "sharp" a screen is, whether it be a TV, camera or computer screen. The reason that an image appears sharp or fuzzy is the number of pixels in the display -- the greater the number of pixels, the sharper the image.
