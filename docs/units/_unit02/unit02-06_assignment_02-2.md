Now that you have seen some of the basics, it's time to practice again on your own. The following tasks serve as an orientation framework within which you can practice in a targeted manner. Please read this [review of classification approaches in remote sensing](https://isgindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/016.pdf) and perform the following tasks:

{% capture Assignment-1-2 %}
1. If not already done, improve your training data and digitize the classes "buildings", "fields", "meadows","forest/trees/hedges" and "roads", 
1. Please apply the techniques described above on both the Sentinel-2 dataset and the airborne imagery dataset.
1. Read and work through the following [section](https://rspatial.org/raster/rs/5-supclassification.html). Please apply the evaluation and tuning part on the CART model described above. What is your finding with respect to model quality and improvement in comparison to the default  setting of the model and the unsupervised classification? Write a sentence (or two) that make suggestions for what we still need for a valid and optionally improved classification.

Again put your code and results in an `Rmarkdown` file and compile it to a PDF document for upload on ILIAS.
