{% capture Assignment-03-2 %}



1.	Adapt your modeling workflow from the last exercise to the spatial prediction. If the computing power of your PC is not sufficient, you can just perform the LLO cross-validation.
2.	Create again a map of your spatial prediction and perform a validation as in the last exercise.
3.	Write 5 sentences in which you compare the results with the results from the traditional random forest model (with random CV). Are there things that stand out to you? 

Again put your code and results in an ´Rmarkdown´ file and compile it to a PDF document for upload on ILIAS.
