{% capture Assignment-04 %}



Follow the first exercise of Unit 04. Then change the workflow in a way that you can use your selfmade training polygons (you used in the last exercise to train the random forest model) to create a raster mask.
1.	Modify the code in such a way that you can export the self-created polygon as a raster mask and . png images.
2.	Create a map on which the created raster mask is displayed.

Again put your code and results in an ´Rmarkdown´ file and compile it to a PDF document for upload on ILIAS.
