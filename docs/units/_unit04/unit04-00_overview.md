This unit is all about your final team project. Think about your research question and create a project outline as basis for your project. 
To finish this course it is mandatory to submit the final team project.

<!--stimmt das so?-->

## Recap
In unit 3, we looked at spatial prediction. From a simple random forest model without spatial aspects, 
we developed a modeling approach that takes into account the spatiality of the data in different parts of the modeling. 
In unit 4 we dealt with the recognition of spatial structures using the convolutional neuronal network U-Net.


## This unit
You have almost made it!  This is the last unit of the course in which you will apply what you have learned in the past units. 
Now you will be challenged to create your own team project from scratch that uses a machine learning or deep learning method for making spatial predictions.


## Learning objectives

At the end of this unit you should be able to
* develop a research question,
* plan and realize a research project from scratch, and
* present your project in an appropriate format.
