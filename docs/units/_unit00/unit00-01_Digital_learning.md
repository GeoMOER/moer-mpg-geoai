Our first session of this course will be at the university only. Subsequent sessions will be in a hybrid format, meaning that some of the students may attend the sessions in person at the [Department of Environmental Informatics](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb19/disciplines/physisch/environmentalinformatics){:target="_blank"} in Marburg. The room number is 00A19. You can also participate online: Details about the virtual classroom and how to get there were sent by email to all participants.

We will use [Big Blue Button](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/hrz/services/web-conferences/web-conferencing-with-bigbluebutton){:target="_blank"} as a virtual classroom for our synchronous (hybrid) sessions.
