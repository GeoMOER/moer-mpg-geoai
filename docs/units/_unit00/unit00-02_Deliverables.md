We distinguish between unmarked and marked deliverables ("Studien- und Prüfungsleistung"). Both are required for passing the course but only the latter is marked, making up your final grade for the course.

Students will need to deliver unmarked assignments on a regular basis ("homework") and must end the course with a (team) project, which will be marked.
Details on the individual assignments and whether or not they will be marked can be found in the respective units.


Upload your assignments to ILIAS at least 15 minutes before the start of the next session.
