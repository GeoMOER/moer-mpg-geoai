After you have written your project outline and have received feedback on it, 
it will be your task to realize a full research project on the basis of your project outline and individual feedback


### Content and structure

The content and structure of your research project follows your project outline, with a few modifications, see below.
The final product of your research project will be a research article.

### Format

* Create one pdf file.
* Follow the structure you already used for the project outline.
* Do not exceed 5000 words (excluding references).
* Make your format consistent, e.g. font size, line spacing, text in display items, references, citations,  etc. 
* Use a serif-free font.
* Create visually appealing display items. This is especially true for your main display item(s).
* Include an abstract after the title, which mirrors the content and structure of your project (250 words maximum).
* Do not include a timetable (only in the project outline).
* Do a sound literature review and properly cite peer-reviewed articles. Roughly aim to include 20-50 references.
* Add the code for reproducing *all* of your results as part of the supplementary material of your pdf and properly format it as you alread did in the assignments.



### Remarks   
To receive your final grade and the ECTS for the course it is mandatory to finish and submit your team project in time.
