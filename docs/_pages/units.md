This course introduces you to using artificial intelligence (AI) in the geosciences. Over 5 units, you will learn about remote sensing as well as how to work with different types of spatial data and use AI to make spatial predictions about variables. One of the units can be covered by several course sessions.

The first two units introduce concepts and approaches that are crucial to environmental geography. The next two units build upon this basis by introducing methods for using AI to make reliable predictions of variables in space where no measurements are available. 

Finally, the last unit(s) guide you through the process of conducting your own project with spatial data and how to implement, document and present your research.

This course assumes some basic knowledge of AI and some previous experience with the programming language R. If you need to refresh your knowledge about AI, we recommend reviewing the introductory courses from the Honours KI program before you continue with GeoAI. If you have little or no experience using R, we recommend reviewing some of the instructors' other online coursework available at OER Marburg, such as [Base R](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-base-r/){:target="_blank"} and a more advanced [Data Analysis in R](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-mpg-data-analysis/){:target="_blank"}.
